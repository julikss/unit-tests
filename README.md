# Unit tests. CI
The project is created to learn the basics of unit testing and CI in GitHub. Another aim of this project is to create **Singly Circular Linked List** - a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle and consists of only one addition pointer named 'Next'.

## Setup
1. Install Node JS

2. Clone the repository with the following command:
```bash
https://github.com/julikss/unit-tests.git
```

3. Open the project folder and install NPM packages:
```bash
npm install
```

4. To run the program use this command:
```bash
node list.js
```

## Test

To run unit tests use the following command in the terminal of your project folder:
```bash
